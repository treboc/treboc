## Welcome!

### About me 🍃
I'm Marvin, living in Germany. I'm working as an certified geriatric nurse for over 12 years now.
Becoming a software developer was always my dream and I'm working on making the dream come true.

- 🔩 I'm working on becoming an iOS dev,
- 📚 I’m currently learning Swift, UIKit & SwiftUI,
- 💬 Open mind about a lot of things,
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

### What am I working on?
- [TriomiCount](https://github.com/vogelfrey/TriomiCount), an App mainly for private use to keep track of our Triominous sessions
- [Snaked](https://github.com/vogelfrey/Snaked), a simple 'Snake'-like game, born with the help of my daughter (was a lot of fun)
- 100daysOfSwiftUI (70 / 100)
- iOS Course of Angela Yu (185 / 555)

## My goals for 2022
