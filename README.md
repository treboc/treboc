## Welcome! 👋🏻

### About me 👨🏼‍💻
I'm Marvin, living in Germany. I'm working as an certified geriatric nurse for over 12 years now, currently I'm a station manager for the last three years.
Becoming a software developer was always my dream and I'm working on making the dream come true.

### What am I working on? 📚
- [8lttrs](https://github.com/treboc/WordScramble)
- [TriomiCount](https://github.com/treboc/TriomiCount), an App mainly for private use to keep track of our Triominous sessions
- multiple smaller things to learn mainly UIKit
